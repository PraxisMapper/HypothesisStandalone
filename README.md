# HypothesisStandalone
PraxisMapper's Offline Mobile Game shell.

Hypothesis Standalone is a demo of some single player location-based games you could build on with PraxisMapper.
Current modes include:
* Paint the Town (walk around, covering area to get points. Bonus points for daily or weekly visits to the same cells)

To make your own mobile game with this:
* Download this source code to your PC
* Load the data necessary for the area you want your game to cover into your instance of PraxisMapper
** See the PraxisMapper repo for instructions on that
* Set the export path for Solar2d to this folder
* Run the exportStandaloneDB command with the area you want to cover
* Build this app in Solar2D
